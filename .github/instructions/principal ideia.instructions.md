# Principal Idea
the principal ideia of this repo is communicate to a IHM and request a csv file, extract that data and insert into a database. 
The IHM will be responsible for the user interface, allowing users to upload CSV files and interact with the data. The backend will handle the extraction of data from the CSV files and manage the database operations.
